I'm currently teaching Computational Language Neuroscience (PSYC 599) and the Neuroscience Honors Seminar and Honors Thesis (NEUR 493/494) courses at USC. 

## Computational Language Neuroscience [`website`](https://snastase.github.io/teaching/psyc599)<br><sup>PSYC 599</sup>

This course explores the computational parallels between deep learning models for language and the human brain. Classes will primarily comprise student-led presentations of the weekly readings and active discussions of different viewpoints in the literature. Early readings are rooted in historical debates surrounding symbolic computation, statistical learning, and connectionism; later readings focus on current developments in the computational neuroscience of language and communication, with a focus on large language models (LLMs). Programming exercises will provide a hands-on introduction to state-of-the-art methods used in computational language neuroscience. The second half of the course will culminate in group projects where students design, implement, and write up novel experiments combining language models (e.g., LLMs) and open neuroscience datasets (e.g., fMRI, ECoG). The intended audience for this course is PhD students in psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, or computer science.

I've also recently given guest lectures in Mary Sweeney’s "Creative Consciousness and Cinematic Dreams" (CTWR 441) course in Cinematic Arts, Jon May’s "Advanced Natural Language Processing" (CSCI 662) course in Computer Science, and Shan Luo’s "Advanced Overview of Neurosciences" (NSCI 525) course in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at USC.

## Previous courses

I was previously a lecturer at Princeton University teaching the 300-level undergraduate course "Mathematical Tools for Neuroscience" (NEU 314) and the graduate-level course "Cognitive Computational Neuroscience" (NEU 502B).

## Mathematical Tools for Neuroscience [`website`](https://snastase.github.io/teaching/neu314)<br><sup>NEU 314</sup>

This course introduces students to the mathematical tools at the core of computational neuroscience research. The course aims to familiarize students with topics in linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning, with a heavy emphasis on applications to neurobiology. Lectures on each topic will develop the relevant mathematical background with links to foundational applications in the field. Coursework will focus primarily on problem sets requiring the implementation of models and analyses in Python. The course will equip students with a practical proficiency in various computational methods, including programming skills in data analysis and visualization that are increasingly important to scientific inquiry in general, and neuroscience in particular.

## Cognitive Computational Neuroscience [`website`](http://snastase.github.io/teaching/neu502b)<br><sup>NEU 502B</sup>

This lab course surveys the methodological landscape of cognitive computational neuroscience research. Students will learn the fundamentals of experimental design, data collection, preprocessing, and statistical analysis for fMRI and EEG/MEG, with an emphasis on best practices in reproducible neuroscience. Lectures will set the conceptual foundation for interactive, hands-on lab work using Jupyter notebooks. Advanced topics include multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), representational similarity analysis (RSA), and regularized encoding models. This year, we're experimenting with a new format that will interleave two threads: empirical (*E*) classes focused on fMRI and MEG projects, and computational (*C*) classes focused on modeling and neural networks. *E* classes will provide the empirical backbone of the course, while *C* classes (typically on Wednesdays) will focus on interactive modeling exercises paralleling the topics discussed in 502A. These two threads will converge over the course of the term. Students will be expected to design, analyze, and write up a both an fMRI experiment and an OPM-MEG experiment as graded projects.
