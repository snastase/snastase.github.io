I'm currently a research scholar and lecturer working with [Uri Hasson](https://www.hassonlab.com/) and [Ken Norman](https://compmem.princeton.edu/) at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. I completed my PhD with [Jim Haxby](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College.

The core questions driving my research are **"What is shared between individual brains?"** and **"How do we share our thoughts with one another?"**—using language and other coordinated actions. My core expertise is in developing naturalistic experimental paradigms—using fMRI and ECoG—to better answer these questions in real-world contexts. My current work uses deep learning to better understand the neural computations driving social cognition.

### Recent work
For an example of our most recent work, check out this project led by [Zaid Zada](https://zaidzada.com/) now published in *Neuron*: [`link`](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.06.025). We use embeddings from a large language model to track the flow of linguistic information from one brain to another in face-to-face conversations between pairs of ECoG patients.
