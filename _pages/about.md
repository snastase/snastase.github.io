I'm currently a research scholar and lecturer working with [Uri Hasson](https://www.hassonlab.com/) and [Ken Norman](https://compmem.princeton.edu/) at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. I completed my PhD with [Jim Haxby](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College.

In my research, we use machine learning models to better understand the neural machinery supporting human communication and cooperation in real-world contexts. I'm currently working on three related topics: (_a_) using large language models to capture how information is transmitted from brain to brain via spoken narratives, (_b_) using deep reinforcement learning to study emergent cooperative behavior and "brain-to-brain" coupling in fully synthetic ecosystems, and (_c_) developing resources for a more community-driven cognitive neuroscience.
