I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology and lead the [<span style="color: #990000;">**Shared Minds Lab**</span>](https://shared-minds.github.io/) at the University of Southern California. Previously, I worked as a research scholar with [Uri Hasson](https://www.hassonlab.com/) and [Ken Norman](https://compmem.princeton.edu/) at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. I completed my PhD with [Jim Haxby](http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College.

The core questions driving my research are **"What is shared between individual brains?"** and **"How do we share our thoughts with one another?"**—using language and other coordinated actions. My research combines naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms (fMRI, ECoG) and deep neural networks to better answer these questions in real-world contexts. In current work, we're leveraging large language models to better understand how humans use language to transmit complex thoughts from one brain to another.

**I'll be recruiting PhD students at USC this year to start in Fall 2026!**

### Recent work
For an example of our recent work, check out this project led by [Zaid Zada](https://zaidzada.com/) now published in *Neuron*: [`link`](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.06.025). We use embeddings from a large language model to track the flow of linguistic information from one brain to another in face-to-face conversations between pairs of ECoG patients.
